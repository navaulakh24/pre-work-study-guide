          <li>The lang="" tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The header and footer include width, height, background-colour, and colour.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup (display, height, width, margins). </li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>The h1 and h2 rule assignment is a positioning property (text-align).</li>
          <li>The p sector involves the format for text alignment and font-size.</li>
          <li>The ul element involves padding direction (left/right) and font size.</li>
          <li>You need to link an external CSS file to the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
